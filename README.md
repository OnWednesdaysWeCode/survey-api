# This or That
## (Team Project)
This or That is a survey app that allows you to create fun, short polls that you can share with your friends, family, and coworkers.

Users can log in and take surveys voting for this or that! Do you like pumpkin spice lattes or apple cider? Pumpkin pie or apple pie?

## Development Process
Back-end (Catherine)
Front-end

### Planning Process
Trello
Scrum
Discuss proper git workflow -- especially with working remotely from each other
Emphasis good communication!!

#### User Stories
- Sign up, sign in, change password, sign out
- Create a survey for other users to take
- Update/Edit my survey

- Take a survey
- See results from surveys

#### Wireframes
We started with a basic wireframe and evolved our wireframe from there.

#### Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
We decided to do a embedded relationship between documents. Users have many surveys, surveys have many responses. User can create and edit their own surveys, but any user can take surveys.

### Future Goals
Custom urls to share surveys
Functionality to only be able to take a survey once
Display surveys one at a time and have a take random survey button
